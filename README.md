# Translating new languages
If the language you wish to translate is not here follow these steps:

1. Create a user on GitHub.com.
2. Email us at contact@blazingpitchforks.com telling us the language and your GitHub user name. We will create a language file for you to work with.
3. Once approved, make your translation and push it to GitHub. It will be included with future releases.

# Contributing to existing translations

If you think one of the translations is missing pieces or has mistakes or just want to help please follow these steps:

1. Create a user on GitHub.com.
2. Edit the specified file and submit a pull request for us to accept

Make sure to work with the other translators to improve the translation. Please try to contact existing translators before changing stuff. If you want to constantly update a language send us an email at contact@blazingpitchforks.com and we will give you permission so we don't have to worry about pull requests.

# How to translate

To translate just change the text in between the > & < arrow to the appropriate version in the language file you are editing for example:
    ```To change 'Yes' To 'I I!' we would edit the line:
    <Yes>Yes</Yes>
    To:
    <Yes>I I!</Yes>```

This would replace in game the word Yes with I I!

# To Test Translations In Game
Navigate to the following directory:
Windows: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\Not Enough Games\Blazing Pitchforks\LanguageFiles
Mac: blah
Linux/Steam OS: blah

Then copy your new language file into that directory, make sure it has a custom name e.g TestLanguage. Relaunch/Launch the game then go to Options>General then change the language dropdown to your custom test language.

# Note: 
All In Game Text Use The Language.txt File For Steam Requirements Please Make Edit's To The Global File. If You Wish To Translate A Steam Store Page Feel Free To Send Us An Email At contact@blazingpitchforks.com For More Info.
